        <h1>Teacup - Testing Framework for Communication Protocols and Web Services</h1>
        <p>Teacup makes it possible to test communication protocols. The core project is not dependent on any engine,
            protocol or reporter, making the framework flexible and powerful.</p>
        <p>The idea is that it should be easy to add/change/remove engines, protocols and reporters without changing
            any of the API's.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create your test project</li>
            <li>Choose engine(s)</li>
            <li>Choose protocol(s)</li>
            <li>Choose reporter(s)</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Core</h1>
        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>The core project has three main responsibilities and does not rely on any special test engine or protocol:
        </p>
        <h4>Assertions</h4>
        <p>A big library with all the base assertions such as arrays, lists and primitives.</p>
        <h4>Interfaces</h4>
        <p>Interfaces such as Executor, Node and Server.</p>
        <h4>Setup</h4>
        <p>Support for fixtures and other setup-related functionality.</p>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>
        The framework does not rely on any specific test engine or protocol.<br>
            It is built to be able to be easy to use, extend and maintain.</p>
        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>This is possible due to highly use of interfaces and almost none of the implementation classes are exposed
            to the public.</p>
        <p>The core project does not know anything about the test engine or protocols implemented, which makes the
            project very isolated.</p>
        <h3>Where</h3>
        <p>The project is found <a href="https://github.com/HenryssonDaniel/teacup-java-core" title="core">here</a>:</p>
        <h1>Engine</h1>
        <h2>JUnit</h2>
        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>Custom JUnit 5 engine.<br>
            This engine interacts with the Teacup core project to get fixture data, such as the current fixture and
            added clients/servers.</p>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>It can be time and resource consuming to use fixtures.<br>
            Therefore this engine will change the order of the tests before executing them so that the minimal fixture
            changes are required.</p>
        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>This is done by extending the Jupiter engine.<br><br>
            To use the Teacup engine, do as follows:<br></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a file named org.junit.platform.engine.TestEngine in src/main/resources/META-INF/services</li>
            <li>Add the content org.teacup.engine.junit.TeacupTestEngine</li>
            <li>Add the engine to the build file, this is different depending on the build tool you are using.<br>
                The best thing is to check this
                <a href="https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#running-tests-build" title="guide">
                    guide</a>:</li>
            <li>Write your tests as you would normally do with JUnit.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Protocol</h1>
        <h2>HTTP</h2>
        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>HTTP version 1.1 and 2 support.<br><br>
        The framework supports asynchronously and synchronously requests.<br><br>
            There is also support for an HTTP/HTTPS server.</p>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>This makes it possible to test HTTP with the framework, both the client and the server.</p>
        <h3>How</h3>
        <p>Add this repository as a dependency.<br><br>
            The Simple interface holds all the functionality that the HTTP client can do.<br>
            New clients can be created with the Factory class in the client package.<br><br>
            The Simple interface holds all the functionality that the HTTP server can do.<br>
            New servers can be created with the Factory class in the server package.</p>

        <h1>Report</h1>
        <h2>File</h2>
        <h3>What</h3>
        <p>This project makes it possible to save logs on disc rather than just publish on the screen.</p>
        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>Save the logs on disc so that they are not deleted after each test execution, no matter what test engine
            you are using.</p>
        <h3>How</h3>
