        <h1>Teacup - Testing Framework for Communication Protocols and Web Services</h1>
        <p>Teacup makes it possible to test communication protocols. The core project is not dependent on any engine,
            protocol or reporter, making the framework flexible and powerful.</p>
        <p>The idea is that it should be easy to add/change/remove engines, protocols and reporters without changing
            any of the API's.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create your test project</li>
            <li>Choose engine(s)</li>
            <li>Choose protocol(s)</li>
            <li>Choose reporter(s)</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Core</h1>
        <h2>What</h2>
        <p>The core project has three main responsibilities and does not rely on any special test engine or protocol:</p>
        <h3>Assertions</h3>
        <p>A big library with all the base assertions such as arrays, lists and primitives.</p>
        <h3>Interfaces</h3>
        <p>Interfaces such as Executor, Node and Server.</p>
        <h3>Setup</h3>
        <p>Support for fixtures and other setup-related functionality.</p>
        <h2>Why</h2>
        <p>
        The framework does not rely on any specific test engine or protocol.<br>
            It is built to be able to be easy to use, extend and maintain.</p>
        <h2>How</h2>
        <p>This is possible due to highly use of interfaces and almost none of the implementation classes are exposed to the public.</p>
        <p>The core project does not know anything about the test engine or protocols implemented, which makes the project very isolated.</p>
        <h2>Where</h2>
        <p>The project is found <a href="https://github.com/HenryssonDaniel/teacup-java-core">here</a>:</p>
